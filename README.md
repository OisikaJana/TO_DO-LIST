# TO_DO-LIST
Simple To_Do list making by js

Explanation:
HTML: This file contains the structure of the to-do list. An input field allows users to add tasks, and a button triggers the addition of tasks to the list. The tasks are displayed in an unordered list (<ul>).

CSS: This file styles the to-do list. It makes the to-do list visually appealing with padding, borders, and hover effects.

JavaScript: This file contains the logic for the to-do list. When the user clicks the "Add Task" button, the addTask() function adds the new task to the list. Each task has two buttons: one to mark it as complete (with a line-through effect) and another to delete it from the list.
